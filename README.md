# Obsidian KanLine (KANban + pipeLINE) plugin

The plugin lets you manage notes the same way the CardBoard plugin manages tasks—by distributing them across tags.

In this setup, you can specify a Dataview query for initial filtering of notes, and then assign a status‐tag to each column (for example, #todo, #doing, #done). Notes are arranged into columns based on their tags. When you drag a note from one column to another, its tag is automatically updated, letting you build your own pipeline—whether it’s for idea refinement, fleeting notes, projects, books, or anything else. Create unlimited boards and tailor pipelines exactly to your workflow.
